# Hospitality-Revenue-Insights-

Developed a dynamic Power BI dashboard for AtliQ Grands, using historical booking data to provide actionable insights into revenue, occupancy, and performance across properties.
Utilized Power Query for data cleaning, DAX for calculating key metrics (RevPAR, ADR, occupancy), and designed a star schema for optimal data relationships.
Created interactive visualizations with filters for deep analysis, enabling the company to adjust pricing strategies and improve decision-making, resulting in enhanced revenue management and market share recovery.
